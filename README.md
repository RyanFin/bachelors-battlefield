# Bachelors Battlefield

This is a React application that highlights areas on Earth and ranks the areas in accordance to the difficulty it is dating as a man in that location.

## Tiers
Here are some dating warrior game difficulties, inspired by The Last of Us difficulty tiers:

Casual Flirt (Easy) – Women smile at you first, conversations flow effortlessly, and numbers are handed out like free samples. Even if you fumble, they find it cute.
Social Charmer (Normal) – You have to put in effort, but with decent confidence and conversation skills, you get regular dates. Occasional rejections sting but are manageable.
Heartbreaker (Hard) – Women are more skeptical, conversations require finesse, and ghosting is common. A single misstep can cost you the connection.
Emotional Survivor (Survivor Mode) – Every approach is a battle. Rejections pile up, dates are scarce, and self-doubt creeps in. Only the most resilient survive.
Lonely Warrior (Grounded) – No second chances. No hints of interest. Ghosting is inevitable. Every interaction feels like an uphill struggle, and even small victories are rare.

## Details
